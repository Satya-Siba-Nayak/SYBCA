# SYBCA Notes Repository

This folder contains notes for all subjects in the SYBCA (Second Year of Bachelor of Computer Applications) course.  Each subject's notes are organized within its own subfolder.

*   **Subject Folders:** Each subject has its own dedicated folder (e.g., "Data Structure With C", "Linear Algebra","Advanced of Web Technology","Spiritual and Cultural Heritage Indian Experier").  The folder name clearly indicates the subject.
*   **Unit Files:** Within each subject folder, notes are typically organized by unit or topic.

## How to Use These Notes

1.  **Browse:** Navigate to the folder corresponding to the subject you're interested in.
2.  **Read:** Open the Markdown files (.md) within the subject folder to access the notes for specific units or topics.  Markdown files can be easily viewed in any text editor or using a Markdown viewer.  Many code editors (VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom) have built-in Markdown preview.  You can also use online Markdown viewers.
3.  **Contribute :** If you find any errors or would like to add to the notes, you can contribute by following the contribution guidelines (see below).
Here are the updated contribution guidelines for your SYBCA repository, formatted in Markdown:
